Title: Covariance and Correlation(Pearson) for Complete Cases
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2022-11-17
Author: Yijun Guo
Maintainer: Yijun Guo <guoyijun@umich.edu>
Description: modified_cov / modified_cor compute the covariance/correlation of x and y if these are vectors. If x is a matrix and y is not supplied, the covariances/correlations between columns of x are calculated. 
If x and y are both supplied and are matrices, then the covariances/correlations between the columns of x and the columns of y are calculated. For all calculation above, x and y must be complete cases without missing value,
and "pearson" is applied as the method.
